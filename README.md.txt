Turky Chiken is at it again!

His Fowl Coop was so successful, he decided to open up a Coop for Cats and Dogs. Thus, Turky Chiken's Canine and Feline Coop was born!
In this coop, you can admit and adopt live or robotic dogs or cats.
You can interact with all the pets or interact with an individual one, though watch out! Some actions can only be performed on live pets and some can only be performed on robotic pets.
Some only apply to all dogs, and some for just live cats.
The live pets have hunger, thirst, waste, happiness, and health levels. 
The robotic pets have oil, happiness, and health levels.
Some actions increase certain levels, and if some levels drop below a certain threshold, health starts to drop too.
Have fun playing around with Turky Chiken's Canine and Feline Coop!
